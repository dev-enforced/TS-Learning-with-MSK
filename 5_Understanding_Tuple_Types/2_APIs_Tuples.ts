// Where we can actually use tuples
// 1) When we have data coming from some APIs in the form of arrays
// We don't know exactly what the data contains, it can have its own meaning
// 2) So here we can use tuples to avoid making mistakes while manipulating
// the data received from the API because we might not know
// the number of items in the array and the format of the item
// 3) using it with tuples for manipulation makes it easier
